## Install

```bash
npm install -g pake-cli
```

If the installation fails and you are prompted that you do not have permission, please see this [website](https://gist.github.com/Giancarlos/d087f8a9e6516716da98ad0c0f5a8f58) .

Also make sure that you're using a correct Node.js version (`^14.13 || >=16.0.0`). If you're using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node.js version management you may run `nvm use` from the root folder of the project and the correct version will be picked up. Other Node.js version management tools, such as [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) and [tj/n](https://github.com/tj/n), should also have similar feature.

**try not to use `sudo` permissions**, If you must use sudo, you need install rust in you system environment. For Mac, you can use brew to install it. For Linux like Ubuntu, you need apt to install it.

## Usage

```bash
pake url [options]
```

After the packaging, the application defaults to the current working directory. Since the environment needs to be configured for the first packaging, it will take some time. Please wait patiently.

Note: The Rust environment is required for packaging. If you do not have Rust, you will be prompted to confirm the installation. If the installation fails or times out, you can [install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) it yourself.
